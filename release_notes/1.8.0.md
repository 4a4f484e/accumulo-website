title: [DRAFT] Apache Accumulo 1.8.0 Release Notes [DRAFT]
nav: nav_rn_180

*THIS DOCUMENT IS A DRAFT*

Apache Accumulo 1.8.0 is a significant release that includes many important
milestone features which expand the functionality of Accumulo. These include
features related to security, availability, and extensibility. Over
340 JIRA issues were resolved in this version. This includes nearly
200 bug fixes and 71 improvements and 4 new features. See
[JIRA][JIRA_180] for the complete list.

[JIRA_180]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12312121&version=12329879

In the context of Accumulo's [Semantic Versioning][semver] [guidelines][api],
this is a "minor version". This means that new APIs have been created, some
deprecations may have been added, but no deprecated APIs have been removed.
Code written against 1.7.x should work against 1.8.0, likely binary-compatible
but definitely source-compatible. As always, the Accumulo developers take API compatibility
very seriously and have invested much time to ensure that we meet the promises set forth to our users.

## Major Changes

### Speed up WAL roll overs

By creating an active and standby writeahead log entry, the roll becomes just swapping writers.  This was a substantial refactor
in they way WALs worked, but seems to provide a increase in write speed as shown by the simple test below.  The top entry is before
[ACCUMULO-3423][ACCUMULO-3423] and the bottom graph is after the refactor.

### User level API for RFile

Previously the only public API available to write RFiles was via the AccumuloFileOutputFormat. There was no way to read RFiles in the public
API. [ACCUMULO-4165][ACCUMULO-4165] exposes new public API for reading and writing RFiles as well as cleans up some of the internal APIs.

[ACCUMULO-4165]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-4165

### Suspend Tablet assignment for rolling restarts

When a tablet server dies, Accumulo attempted to reassign the tablets as quickly as possible to maintain availability.
A new configuration property `table.suspend.duration` with a default of 0s now controls how long to wait before reassigning
a tablet from a dead tserver.  The property is configurable in Zookeeper, so you can set it, do a rolling restart, and then
set it back to 0.  A new state as introduced, TableState.SUSPENDED to support this feature.  By default, metadata tablet
reassignment is not suspended, but that can also be changed with the `master.metadata.suspendable` property that is false by
default.  Root tablet assignment can not be suspended.  See [ACCUMULO-4353] for more info.

[ACCUMULO-4353]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-4353

### Run multiple Tablet Servers on one node

[ACCUMULO-4328] introduces the capability of running multiple tservers on a single node.  This intended for nodes with a large
amount of memory.  This feature is disabled by default.  There are several related tickets: [ACCUMULO-4072], [ACCUMULO-4331]
and [ACCUMULO-4406].  Note, this changes the names of the log files.  Previous log file names were defined in the
generic_logger.xml as `${org.apache.accumulo.core.application}_${instance}_${org.apache.accumulo.core.ip.localhost.hostname}.log`.
The files will now include the instance id after the application with
`${org.apache.accumulo.core.application}_${instance}_${org.apache.accumulo.core.ip.localhost.hostname}.log`.  For example:
master_1_localhost.log instead of master_localhost.log.  The same change was made to the debug logs as well.

[ACCUMULO-4406]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-4406

### Rate limiting Major Compactions

Major Compactions can overwhelm a tablet server, rendering it nearly unresponsive. [ACCUMULO-4187] take a cue from Apache
Cassandra and restrict how quickly we perform major compactions by rate limiting reads and writes.  This has a direct affect
on the IO load caused by major compactions, and should also indirectly affect the CPU load.  This behavior is controlled
by a new property `tserver.compaction.major.throughput` with a defaults of 0B which disables the rate limiting.

[ACCUMULO-4187]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-4187

### Upgrade to Apache Thrift 0.9.3

Accumulo relies on Apache Thrift to implement remote procedure calls between Accumulo services.
Ticket [ACCUMULO-4077][ACCUMULO-4077] updates our dependency to 0.9.3.  See the [Apache Thrift 0.9.3 Release Notes][THRIFT-0.9.3-RN] for details
on the changes to Thrift.

### Iterator fuzz testing

Users often write iterators without fully understanding its limits and lifetime. Accumulo should have an
iterator fuzz-tester which will take user data and run the iterator under extreme conditions. For example,
it should re-create and re-seek the iterator with every key returned. It could automatically compare results
of such a run with the naive run, which seeks to the beginning and scans all the data.  See
[ACCUMULO-626][ACCUMULO-626] for more details.

[ACCUMULO-626]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-626

### Default port for Monitor changed to 9995

Previously, the default port for the monitor was 50095.  You will need to update your links to point to port 9995.  The default port for the GC process was also changed from 50091 to 9998, although this mostly used internally.  Ticket [ACCUMULO-3409]
documents why the defaults where changed  to something outside the range of ephemeral ports.  These values are still configurable by setting `monitor.port.client`
and `gc.port.client` in the accumulo-site.xml

## Testing

Each unit and functional test only runs on a single node, while the RandomWalk
and Continuous Ingest tests run on any number of nodes. *Agitation* refers to
randomly restarting Accumulo processes and Hadoop Datanode processes, and, in
HDFS High-Availability instances, forcing NameNode failover.
