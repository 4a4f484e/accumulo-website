title: Apache Accumulo 1.7.2 Release Notes
nav: nav_rn_172
---

Apache Accumulo 1.7.2 is a maintenance release on the 1.7 version branch. This
release contains changes from more than 150 issues, comprised of bug-fixes,
performance improvements, build quality improvements, and more. See
[JIRA][JIRA_172] for a complete list.

Users of any previous 1.7.x release are strongly encouraged to update as soon
as possible to benefit from the improvements with very little concern in change
of underlying functionality. Users of 1.6 or earlier that are seeking to
upgrade to 1.7 should consider 1.7.2 as a starting point.

## Highlights

### Write-Ahead Logs can be prematurely deleted

There were cases where the Accumulo Garbage Collector may inadvertently delete a WAL for a tablet server that it has erroneously determined to be down, causing data loss. This has been corrected. See [ACCUMULO-4157][ACCUMULO-4157] for additional detail.

### Upgrade to Commons-VFS 2.1

Upgrading to Apache Commons VFS 2.1 fixes several issues with classloading out of HDFS. For further detail see [ACCUMULO-4146][ACCUMULO-4146]. Additional fixes to a potential HDFS class loading deadlock situation were made in [ACCUMULO-4341][ACCUMULO-4341].

### Native Map failed to increment mutation count properly

There was a bug ([ACCUMULO-4148][ACCUMULO-4148]) where multiple put calls with identical keys and no timestamp would exhibit different behaviour depending on whether native maps were enabled or not. This behaviour would result in hidden mutations with native maps, and has been corrected.

### Open WAL files could prevent DataNode decomission

An improvement was introduced to allow a max age before WAL files would be automatically rolled. Without a max age, they could stay open for writing indefinitely, blocking the Hadoop DataNode decomissioning process. For more information, see [ACCUMULO-4004][ACCUMULO-4004].

### Minor performance improvements.

Tablet servers would previously always hsync at the start of a minor compaction, causing delays in the write pipeline. These additional syncs were determined to provide no additional durability guarantees and have been removed. See [ACCUMULO-4112][ACCUMULO-4112] for additional detail.

A performance issue was identified and corrected ([ACCUMULO-1755][ACCUMULO-1755]) where the BatchWriter would block calls to addMutation while looking up destination tablet server metadata. The writer has been fixed to allow both operations in parallel.


## Other Notable Changes

 * [ACCUMULO-4146][ACCUMULO-4146] Avoid copy of RFile Index Blocks when already in cache.
 * [ACCUMULO-4335][ACCUMULO-4335] Error conditions that result in a Halt should ensure non-zero process exit code.
 * [ACCUMULO-4334][ACCUMULO-4334] Ingest rates reported through JMX did not match rates reported by Monitor.
 * [ACCUMULO-4314][ACCUMULO-4314] Use statistics to choose better keys for RFile index.
 * [ACCUMULO-3923][ACCUMULO-3923] bootstrap_hdfs.sh script would copy incorrect jars to hdfs.
 * [ACCUMULO-4155][ACCUMULO-4155] No longer publish javadoc for non-public API to website. (Still available in javadoc jars in maven)
 * [ACCUMULO-4173][ACCUMULO-4173] Provide balancer to balance table within subset of hosts.

## Testing

Each unit and functional test only runs on a single node, while the RandomWalk
and Continuous Ingest tests run on any number of nodes. *Agitation* refers to
randomly restarting Accumulo processes and Hadoop Datanode processes, and, in
HDFS High-Availability instances, forcing NameNode failover.
