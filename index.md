Apache Accumulo is based on Google's [BigTable][1] design and is built on
top of Apache [Hadoop][2], [Zookeeper][3], and [Thrift][4].  Apache Accumulo features a few novel 
improvements on the BigTable design in the form of cell-based access control and a server-side
programming mechanism that can modify key/value pairs at various points in the
data management process.  Other notable improvements and feature are outlined
[here](notable_features.html).

Google published the design of BigTable in 2006.  Several other open source
projects have implemented aspects of this design including [HBase][5], [Hypertable][6],
and [Cassandra][7].  Accumulo began its development in 2008 and joined the [Apache community][8] in 2011.
