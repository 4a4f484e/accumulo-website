<p>This example shows running a simple reservation system implemented using
conditional mutations. This system guarantees that only one concurrent user can
reserve a resource. The exampleâ€™s reserve command allows multiple users to be
specified. When this is done, it creates a separate reservation thread for each
user. In the example below threads are spun up for alice, bob, eve, mallory,
and trent to reserve room06 on 20140101. Bob ends up getting the reservation
and everyone else is put on a wait list. The example code will take any string
for what, when and who.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./bin/accumulo org.apache.accumulo.examples.simple.reservations.ARS
&gt;connect test16 localhost root secret ars
  connected
&gt;
  Commands :
    reserve &lt;what&gt; &lt;when&gt; &lt;who&gt; {who}
    cancel &lt;what&gt; &lt;when&gt; &lt;who&gt;
    list &lt;what&gt; &lt;when&gt;
&gt;reserve room06 20140101 alice bob eve mallory trent
                   bob : RESERVED
               mallory : WAIT_LISTED
                 alice : WAIT_LISTED
                 trent : WAIT_LISTED
                   eve : WAIT_LISTED
&gt;list room06 20140101
  Reservation holder : bob
  Wait list : [mallory, alice, trent, eve]
&gt;cancel room06 20140101 alice
&gt;cancel room06 20140101 bob
&gt;list room06 20140101
  Reservation holder : mallory
  Wait list : [trent, eve]
&gt;quit
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Scanning the table in the Accumulo shell after running the example shows the
following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@test16&gt; table ars
root@test16 ars&gt; scan
room06:20140101 res:0001 []    mallory
room06:20140101 res:0003 []    trent
room06:20140101 res:0004 []    eve
room06:20140101 tx:seq []    6
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The tx:seq column is incremented for each update to the row allowing for
detection of concurrent changes. For an update to go through, the sequence
number must not have changed since the data was read. If it does change,
the conditional mutation will fail and the example code will retry.</p>
