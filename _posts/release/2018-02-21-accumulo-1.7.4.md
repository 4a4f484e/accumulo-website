ACCUMULO-1972 fix Range constructor
    
    Updated Range constructor to use a private implementation of
    beforeStartKey, so that it does not cause a problem if a subclass
    overrides the public beforeStartKey method.

[ACCUMULO-4506] Add a timeout to a replication RPC call
    
    This addresses an issue where a replication task will get stuck for a
    substantial amount of time.  Using a timeout for the client will abandon
    the task after 2m (default) for a single RPC attempt.  Note that this is
    related to the replication.work.attempts property, as a client timeout
    will be retried by the same task up to this number of times before being
    abandoned entirely.

ACCUMULO-4665 Use UGI with real Kerberos credentials
    
    UGI supports the notion of users without credentials being
    "proxied" (riding on top of) another user which does have
    credentials. This is authorized via configuration. These
    changes allow this scenario more naturally and remove
    unnecessarily strict assertions in KerberosToken.

commit #1: ACCUMULO-4685 Fix bug in FileRefTest
    
    Fix bug in test because of retrieval from collection of wrong type.
commit #2: ACCUMULO-4685 Remove unneeded code
    
    Remove unneeded semicolons (empty blocks), generic type parameters (use
    diamond operator), and import statements (same package).
commit #3: ACCUMULO-4685 Remove more warnings
    
    Fix some more obscure warnings by ensuring type safety when using
    collections methods which take "Object" instead of the expected type.
    This prevents coding problems masked by the fact that a generic
    Collection can never contain objects which aren't of the type in that
    Collection.
    
    Avoid use of unsafe (non-commutative) equals implementations which can
    compare "apples with apple seeds". For example:
      new Value(b = new byte[]{...}).equals(b)
    or
      new ProcessReference(p = new Process(...)).equals(p)
    
    Remove some unnecessary casts of char to int.

commit #1: ACCUMULO-4779 fixed classpath context config performance issue (#358)
commit #2: ACCUMULO-4779 Avoid locks in ZooCache when data in cache
    
    ZooCache was using read and write locks.  For the case where lots
    of threads were accessing data present in the cache the read locks
    were really slowing things down.  This commit switches to immutable
    copies of all the data present in the cache which require no locks
    to access.  When the cache changes the immutable copies are
    regenerated and then made available.

ACCUMULO-4780 Add overflow check to seq num in CommitSession (#360)
    
    Add overflow check to sequence number in CommitSession.
    
    Ticket suggested adding overflow check to sequence number or converting to long.
    This PR converted the sequence number from and int to long to prevent fear of future
    overflow. The change propagated to several other files that made use of or called
    methods that utilized the sequence number.
    
    Modified the various files and then re-ran tests and integration tests to verify nothing
    had broken. All tests passes.
